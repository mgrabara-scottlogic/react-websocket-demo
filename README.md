# Simple React-socket.io Chat App

This repository is a fruit of my frustration with not working socket.io examples in the training document.
It implements the simple chat app from the example in a clear to understand way.

## Running the app

1. `npm install` needs to be run in BOTH _client_ and _server_ directories.
2. Start server by executing node app.js within _server_ directory.
3. Start backend by running `npm start` in the _client_ directory.

## Directory structure:
```
├───client - Front-end app in React
│   ├───public
│   └───src
│       └───features
└───server - Express back-end app
```
